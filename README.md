Project 3: Multi-threaded Web Server

The purpose of this project is to construct a multi-threaded web server using POSIX threads (pthreads) in C language to learn about thread programming and synchronization methods. Your web server should be able to handle these file type: HTML, GIF, JPEG, TXT. and of any arbitrary size. It should handle a limited portion of the HTTP web protocol (namely, the GET command to fetch a web page / files). We will provide pieces of code (some already compiled into object files, and some source) that will help you complete the lab.

Project template and description pdf are presented in the P3.zip (Files > Projects > P3 > P3.zip).

In P3, there are two extra credit options, so please plan ahead and start the project early to get 12 points from this project. 

 

You should submit two times for project 3. Please find the details in the write-up.

1. [Due: 5PM, Nov. 18] Interim submission: a zip file including server.c and 1-page interim report.

2. [Due: 5PM, Nov. 25] Final submission: a zip file including all source files, readme, and interim report.
