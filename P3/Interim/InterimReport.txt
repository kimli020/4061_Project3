3. 
Our group's plan is to implement Extra Credit A: Dynamic worker thread pool

In our implementation of the queue we will keep track of the number of actual elements in it, which is the server load. We will choose an appropriate worker:load ratio (e.g. 10 server requests/1 worker). 

qlen is the max capacity of the queue (i.e. the max server load) so we could initialize by creating enough threads to service, say, 50% of that load. Our dynamic_pool_size_update will routinely check the current server load (i.e. queue size) and adjust the number of workers based on the worker:load ratio we chose. We would not allow thread deletion if there is only one worker.
